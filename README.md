hpastie - An unusably simple paste bin written in Haskell
========================================================

hpastie is a very simple toy paste bin written in
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/). It was written as an exercise in
learning the [Snap web framework](http://snapframework.com/).

It hasn't been updated in quite some time and is unlikely to receive any
further attention from me. It doesn't build on GHC 7.4.1, due to
incompatible dependencies, and may no longer build on any GHC for the
same reason.  In short:

Move along, there is nothing to see here.
